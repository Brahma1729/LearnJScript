There are 7 Primitive datatypes in JS

1. Boolean
2. Number
3. Bigint
4. null - declared with null Because JS is casesensitive null is not same as Null or Null
5. Undefined - whose value is not defined
6. String -> Immutable
7. Symbol -> Unique and Immutable

other one important datatype is "Object"

except above 7 all are objects in JS


Difference between var, let and const

once if variable is declared we can't redeclare with let  but it's possible with var
eg :
var a = 10;
var a = 20; // redeclaring the already declared variable a

let b =10;
b = 20; // U can change the value but not allow to redeclare like let b = 20;

Once declare any variable with const u can't change it's value

another difference between var and let is declaring in for loop

for(var i =0;i<5;i++) // outside for loop also we can access variable i

for (let i=0; i<5; i++) // outside of for loop we can't access variable i

** Don't ever use var, always use let or const
